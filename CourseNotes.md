`Business Layer` ----------------> `Data Layer`

`Business Logic To Do` -------> `Data Service Logic To Do`

    The Business Layer may need to call the Data Layer to retrieve some data therefore
    the Business Layer will be dependent on the Data Layer thus making the Data Layer 
    a 'DEPENDENCY' for the Business Layer. 
    WHY?
    Because the without the Data Layer the Business Layer will not function as expected.
